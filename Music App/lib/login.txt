After Login with OAuth , if you want to skip the Login Screen 
Store the token either in SQLite or SharePrefrences
Or most better way is Flutter Secure Storage

This does AES Encryption of the data so it will be Secure
Now store the token and every time app launces compare this token with Firebase 
So that we don't have to login again

When we login with Gmail -> Gmail sends Token to Firebase DB -> Then it passes to APK
